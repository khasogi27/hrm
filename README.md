## How To Run

### required :  
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Node.js | Angular requires an [active LTS or maintenance LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version of Node.js. For more information on installing Node.js, see [nodejs.org.](https://nodejs.org/en/) If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run **node -v** in a terminal window. |
| npm package manager | Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) command line interface, which is installed with **Node.js** by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run **npm -v** in a terminal window. | 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
